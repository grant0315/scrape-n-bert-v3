{"content": "If you're in a creative business and have ever created content, you know how important it is. But you probably also know sometimes dry spells and failures come with content. Every business wants to read our audiences\u2019 minds to understand their pain points, needs and meet their expectations with relevant solutions. But how do we do that?\u00a0 Enter  . While it's not entirely possible to find out all about your audience, social listening gets you very close to what resonates with them. It helps you improve your content, refresh ideas, and provide high-quality solutions to all your customers' challenges. This simple awareness technique helps you understand your customers\u2019 problems and what you can do to resolve them. You can think of it as a research process about your target audience and how they perceive your brand. Social listening gives your content the edge it needs to succeed. It helps you understand your audience better. Here are some of the reasons why social listening is important: As our daily lives shift online, consumers interact more with well-known or established brands because they trust that they offer the right product or service. Developing a comprehensive and actionable social listening strategy is key to building potential   and customer trust. Here are six social listening strategies to get you started.\u00a0 Keeping an eye on your competitors is just as important as monitoring your brand. That way, you'll know how to adapt to new business moves, spot content gaps, and create relevant content. Analyzing your competitors' content will help you identify unaddressed or poorly addressed user problems and guide your social listening strategy toward understanding how your product or service can be a potential solution for them. Personalized conversations are common in the user experience (UX) community, but other sectors overlook them. A personal conversation with your customers can help you identify their pain points and offer solutions. Set up a routine call with your customers if you have the right resources. Ask them about their experience with your offerings and how you can improve them. If you read a   about your brand, does it make sense to respond and participate in such conversations, or is it better to ignore them and move on? Many companies ask for reviews but rarely tackle or respond to them. Your customers are people, and they understand mistakes happen. When you stand by your mistakes and offer better solutions, they appreciate your approach and may return to you. Social media is no longer a one-way channel. You can now use it to talk to your customers, answer questions, and respond to comments.\u00a0 Your   can trigger reactions, comments, reposts, or even viral trends. This gives you more insight into your target audience \u2013 what works and what doesn't. You can use this information when creating new content, advertisements, and publications. Not sure what kind of content to create? Just think of it as an answer to your audience's questions. Proactively listening to your audience\u2019s problems can help you generate plenty of ideas for new content. You can do this through one-on-one customer conversations. You can also answer them through your blogs, social media platforms, and websites. For example, if someone wants to learn how to pack a bike for international shipping, it\u2019d be beneficial for readers to have a guide explaining how to do the job. While this isn't always conversion-oriented, it can be informative and educational. Traditional advertisements no longer work for most of the customers. For example, someone looking for   may turn to alternative channels like online forums to find unbiased information about the process and may find a suitable service offering consolidated shipment. This may include complaining about a product that doesn't work or raving about a product they love. \u00a0Keep an eye on these pages to know your audience\u2019s preferences. Channels like Reddit and Quora allow your customers to express their opinions. If you monitor and filter out the relevant conversations, you can interact with your target audience, address their concerns, and offer solutions. Although considered similar, social listening and social monitoring differ significantly. Social listening focuses on \u201cwhat is being said,\u201d while social monitoring focuses on \u201cwho is saying it and how often\u201d.\u00a0 This is usually done through   to track and gather all relevant information through various online channels. Social listening focuses on your target audience\u2019s questions and issues to help you get insights from the data collected via social monitoring. Social monitoring enables you to capture the buzz around your brand, whereas social listening helps you understand the reason behind that buzz. To sum it up, some of the main differences between the two are: Several customers mention your brand, product, or service and their experience with it. Most importantly, they rely on similar mentions when researching purchase options. Not just customers, many companies turn to review sites like G2 when looking for a new tool or software. Below are some key benefits of social listening. Let's face it. You can\u2019t have meaningful relationships with all your customers. But you can build good relationships with some of them and turn them into true brand advocates. By practicing social listening, you identify the customers who already love your product and let them do the talking. Quality assurance (QA) is an extensive process. When you have a product or service, QA never stops. Anytime you roll out a new feature, the chances are it won't work properly, or your customers just don't like it. You need to listen to what they say about it and offer scope for improvement. You can also use social listening to create stronger and more connected communities. By listening to online conversations and recognizing patterns, you can give your users the answers and content they\u2019re looking for. For example, if your customers are constantly asking certain questions, such as \u201c ?\" you can provide them helpful content on your blog, social media, newsletter, or through other communication channels. Customer acquisition (CA) is crucial for creating a successful product. Attracting a constant stream of new users while keeping the existing ones satisfied ensures growth. But customers are often your biggest advocates and the driving force behind UA. By enticing them to share positive experiences and leave reviews, you can increase your brand\u2019s visibility and drive user acquisition across multiple channels. The easiest way to measure social listening is through social listening metrics. Social listening metrics track customer engagement and behavior and help further your social listening strategies. Some of these metrics are discussed below. Share of Voice (SoV) compares how much value your brand holds in a market with your competitors. The number of mentions or total reach tells you part of the story, but SoV gives you an enhanced perspective. It can show you when your brand awareness is changing and growing. Sentiment analysis uses natural language processing (NLP) or   to analyze online conversations and determine the context and sentiment around them. Data used to research such conversations are collected from different engagement channels and interpreted using NLP. It can tell you what customers think of your brand compared to your competitors. Competition analysis aims to identify other brands\u2019 strengths and weaknesses in your market segment and compare them with your brand. What content do they create? What questions do customers ask? Better yet, what are you missing out on? Which questions could remain unanswered, to which you can give answers? Various factors determine the conversion rate, including analyzing the number of leads, registrations, or downloads. For example, if you run an email marketing campaign with a call-to-action (CTA) to download your new app, the number of app downloads divided by the newsletter recipients is the conversion rate.   Because conversion rate is such a versatile metric, it\u2019s only understood compared to other metrics. It helps you know if you met our business goals, but you still don't know how you met them, where the prospects are from, and what we can do to improve their experience. For this reason, we should critically examine the conversion rate in comparison to other metrics. Influencers, the mythical beasts of social media, revamped marketing. Today, anyone with a smartphone and a few hundred or thousand followers can make an impact by sharing their likes and dislikes. Influencers start conversations, create  , and set trends. If you haven't jumped on this trend yet, you can easily collaborate with influencers using an  . The marketing strength often lies in the numbers, but when it comes to influencers, micro and nano influencers with only a few thousand followers are also enjoying growing popularity. With the tremendous growth in recent years, influencer marketing\u2019s cost has skyrocketed, which small brands can\u2019t budget for. By working with micro-influencers, brands can avoid stretching their marketing budgets and benefit from them. Many companies still struggle while creating content and connecting with their audiences. How do you empower your customers and improve their experience while getting instant feedback and ideas for new content? Just by listening. When customers feel heard, they leave reviews, and others read them. Word of mouth is still one of the most powerful (free) forms of advertising. In addition, trust factors such as quality ratings can influence the conversion rate for your service or product. Not every social listening strategy will work for you but don't think of it as a waste of time. Think of it as a learning opportunity and get to know your customers. Social listening is the first step in  , a powerful and popular sales technique for converting potential social leads into customers. ", "url": "https://learn.g2.com/social-listening"}

This may cause some employers to worry that their employees are looking to quit their job and move onto something better \u2013 but that\u2019s not the case. Contrary to popular belief, offering your employees growth opportunities is more likely to retain top talent than drive them away. Employee loyalty increases the more you invest in the people who work for you. If you\u2019re not already prioritizing growth opportunities in your talent management strategy, you should be. There are several elements that play into\u00a0offering meaningful growth opportunities to your employees. And while your company may offer some of the things mentioned above, there\u2019s always room to improve. Maybe you already offer a snapshot for career growth or utilize a  , but have you ever wondered if there was more you could offer? As the job market continues to become more competitive, companies are finding unique ways to attract new talent.

We asked employees to share a time they had a manager who invested in their growth and explain why it was important to their  . Check out some of their answers! \u201cIt's incredibly important to me that the company I work for focuses on employee development. \"They have put a huge focus on helping us develop our strengths and shore up our weaknesses. This happens on a personal level by walking through the Strengths Finder process in the book,   by Tom Rath and Gallup. \"My company helps us identify our signature strengths and teaches us how to leverage them to grow as professionals. We also have great access to continual video-based and online training resources that help us stay sharp in our individual roles and aware of industry best practices.\u201d \u201cWhen I was told that my new employer would pay for my last semester of my MBA, I was shocked. I had started my MBA program before accepting a position at my current job and had planned to continue completing it on my own. \"It gave me a sense of comfort to know that they supported me on my journey of obtaining my MBA and it gave me relief that they believed in me so much that they were willing to get me across the finish line to graduate. \"Since graduating, my company has invested in other continued learning opportunities that give me the chance to keep growing individually but also take the knowledge and utilize it in my role to help the company continue to grow as well. If you invest in your employees you are ultimately investing in your company. \"Working for a company that has invested in my growth gives me a feeling of appreciation. They saw something in me worth investing in and believed that I was worth that investment. It has given me a type of confidence that I do not believe I would have ever had if I did not feel supported by my company.\u201d \u201cMy first job out of college just happened to be with the largest IT company in the world and I was enamored with it all: the modern building, the mid-century furniture, foosball tables, the laptop I was handed, the travel I was booking - it was so exciting! \"I was driven, and it continued to show as I excelled in implementing large-scale initiatives and progressed through different roles. What I didn\u2019t know at the time was that I could be excelling in other skills \u2014 such as effectively communicating, providing valuable feedback, leading through change, or teaching and trusting others to do their jobs. As my friends at other companies were discussing what they were learning, I began realizing that this was a gap in my development. I began training \u2014 only to meet resistance and be told soft skills training wasn\u2019t in the budget. \"I began wondering, \u2018What happens when a company doesn\u2019t professionally develop its employees and only focuses on results?\u2019 That single thought became a catalyst to my unhappiness. Suddenly the drive that had led to my success was also the drive exposing that where I was could no longer meet my needs. \"I spent a good deal of time considering what my values were and what I would need in an employer to feel motivated. I finally determined that learning and development need to be a part of the culture that I joined and began looking at other companies. \"Today I\u2019m more professionally fulfilled than I ever imagined possible.

I tried taking matters into my own hands by out my own path. I requested a career mentor but instead was scheduled to job shadow a colleague who worked in marketing.

{"content": "Getting my offer to work at G2 was one of the biggest reliefs I\u2019ve had in my career. However, it also provided a unique challenge that I\u2019ve never experienced up until that point. While waiting to hear back about my job offer to work here, I was also involved in the   with a company I considered my backup option. Thankfully, I received offers from both companies. Unfortunately, that meant I had to decline the job offer for another company who I was also incredibly interested in. The task of turning down an offer can sometimes make you feel like you\u2019re damaging your reputation, but with a little poise, you can decline a job offer politely and professionally. Let\u2019s get into the best way to tackle this while reducing any unnecessary anxiety throughout the situation. Feel free to skip ahead to an  . Whether you have another job offer you want to accept instead, had trouble negotiating a salary, or ultimately just want to stay where you are, there are a few important factors of a job offer rejection to keep in mind. Declining a job offer is very similar to  . Here\u2019s where to start when you get the call or email regarding your offer: Before even giving an answer to your contact at the company, you should express your gratitude for being offered the position. By now, you\u2019ve likely gone through a couple of interviews or discussions with the company. They have put forth time and resources in determining whether you\u2019re a good fit and you don\u2019t want that to go unrecognized. This also serves to show friendliness and goodwill to the company. You should aim to send your response almost as soon as you make your final decision. This again is done to show respect to the people you have been communicating with at the company. The sooner you inform them that you are declining a job offer, the sooner they can extend the offer to another candidate. While it\u2019s not absolutely necessary that you provide an excuse for declining a job offer, failing to do so can make you seem deceitful. Rejecting a job offer is almost like breaking up with a company. After interviewing and expressing interest, pulling out of the conversation can leave the hirer feeling rejected. A simple explanation stating that you\u2019ve decided to go in a different direction or that the company\u2019s culture no longer seems like a good fit should suffice. Extending an offer to keep in touch with the contacts you\u2019ve made at the company ensures that you are ending the discussion on good terms. It never hurts to grow your network, especially with people who are familiar with your work and consider you a qualified member of the industry. These connections may benefit you further through your career, so offering to keep contact really can solidify a positive professional relationship down the road. According to a  , the most common reason that candidates rejected a job offer was due to a disappointing compensation package. The responses also showed that many turned down offers in order to accept other positions. This all makes sense when considering that you typically see the most significant change in compensation when making a job change. If the compensation associated with a change isn\u2019t up to par, there\u2019s likely little incentive to make a job switch. In addition, it may be very possible that you just don\u2019t see yourself as a fit within the company\u2019s culture. Throughout the interview process, you were likely to get a clearer picture of the company and its values. Failing to connect with the way a company does business is sometimes enough to push qualified candidates away. Whatever reason you find yourself declining a job offer, you can now do it with confidence. Remember that if you\u2019ve gotten this far, they want you more than you want them and you\u2019ll be just fine. Stay calm, collected, and handle yourself with poise. Be sure to show respect to the company and the people you\u2019ve been in contact with following the process. Choosing to decline an offer is the end of the road for you with this position. It should be noted that turning down a job offer is not a tactic that should be employed to negotiate a better deal as you will not be getting another offer after this point.

When you click on these metrics, the graph changes to show your channel\u2019s progress. Keeping track of this data on a monthly basis is a great way to monitor how successful certain campaigns are. These metrics at the top are a high-level view of your channel and the engagement it\u2019s receiving, but there\u2019s much more to see. Let\u2019s talk about the  homepage. Although we\u2019ve already gone over the metrics at the top, we can go deeper. Now, click  . This is what your screen should look like. There\u2019s a lot of useful information on this page. Every single one of your YouTube videos is listed here broken down by views, watch time, how many subscribers the video earned, impressions, and impressions click-through rate. The first video listed is your most successful video, the second being the second most successful, and so on. It would be a good idea to bookmark this page to track your videos\u2019 progress as you continue to post to YouTube. These metrics show how successful each video you share is. Maybe you post a video of your product or service in action and notice how many views it received and how many people subscribed because of it. You could create a similar video to capitalize on this success. You can also see engagement by a specific category if you click on  and select one from the drop-down menu. For our example, we\u2019ll stick with watch time. By gliding over the graph, you can see how many minutes each video was watched for any specific day. If you\u2019d like to see how your content has been doing over a longer period of time, click   in the top right corner and select a timeframe from the drop-down menu. For this example, we\u2019ll change  to   and change  to  . Looking at your analytics for the past year can give you unparalleled insight as to how certain videos perform month-over-month or how some videos may become relevant again months later. Say you\u2019re a tech company that hosts an annual conference and you share a recap video in 2017. That same video may see engagement the weeks before and after the event in 2018. This is a great way to create content that is sustainable over multiple years. At the top of the page, there are even more metrics for you to explore (yay)! You can learn a lot about your audience by spending some time exploring each tab. If you click on  , you can see how your videos are being discovered, whether that\u2019s as a suggested video, on the YouTube search page, or in a playlist. We\u2019ll talk about this more in-depth later on. If you click on  , you\u2019ll be shown where your videos are being watched. This data is super important. If you know that 54% (the majority) of your audience is from the United States, you wouldn\u2019t waste your time placing your   on videos being watched in Poland (making up only 0.3% of your views). These analytics save you time and money. Make sure to take some time to explore all the data that YouTube provides. By continuously referencing your analytics, you\u2019ll understand your audience more thoroughly and be able to share more content you know they\u2019ll enjoy. We\u2019ve covered the basic metrics you can track to understand how your content is doing on YouTube, but let\u2019s navigate back to the  homepage. Once there, click on  below the  section. On this page, you\u2019ll see all your videos listed, their publish date, and how they\u2019ve been performing the last 48 hours, as well as their activity in the last 60 minutes. These are literal live analytics. If you share a video and want to monitor how well it\u2019s doing within the first couple days of uploading, you can come here and watch your analytics develop in real time. Maybe you\u2019re replying to comments the first day of posting and notice that engagement dropped off after you stopped interacting with the commenters. You can note this for next time and reply to comments consistently as they are posted. Back on the  homepage, we\u2019re going to discover where your audience comes from. Click on  . At the top of the page, there\u2019s a graph that displays  . You can change this parameter by clicking on any of the other options at the top. This graph will show your  engagement over time. The small play button icon even shows you when you posted a video and how well that video performed. Just like before, you can change the category or timespan at any time to view a different set of analytics. Just like  , YouTube informs you of how many  have watched your content. Keep an eye on this number and make sure it\u2019s steadily increasing. Below this orange graph, YouTube provides you with a boatload of stats that let you know how your audience found you. Here, you can determine the way that people discovered your videos. This could be through the YouTube search bar, browse features, suggested videos in the sidebar, curated playlists, etc. You\u2019ll also be able to know what external source they came from (if they were redirected from somewhere else). They may have come from Instagram or Facebook. These analytics tell you that your audience is on other social media platforms separate from YouTube. It would be wise to take note of where they\u2019re coming from and advertise there, too. One of the most interesting analytics in this section is the   box and the  box. Respectively, these boxes will tell you exactly where your viewer came from. The suggested videos box lets you know which video they were watching before clicking on yours, while the YouTube search box lists things your viewers have searched before clicking on your video. These stats are hugely important! If you notice that your viewers are watching a certain influencer before clicking on your videos, it could be a good idea to reach out to that influencer and suggest working together. This could spark the start of an   campaign, which could boost your views and numbers significantly. Little details like this are what matters when tracking your YouTube Analytics. If you know what your viewers are watching, how they\u2019re finding you, and where they\u2019re coming from, you\u2019ll know how to better target them when advertising on the platform. Now that you've been bitten by the data bug, explore all the\u00a0 \u00a0you can use to track your metrics. Although we went over quite a few metrics you could track, there\u2019s still much more to analyze. If it\u2019s your first time looking at your YouTube Analytics, choose the metrics that make the most sense for your business to track and check them every week. Take the time to click around and discover all the data that is available to you. The more you monitor the data, the better you\u2019ll be able to understand where your audience comes from, what content they enjoy most, and how they interact with videos online.

{"content": "A huge challenge that faces app developers today is saturation of the market.\u00a0 More teams are pushing more products and this crowds the various app stores. So, how do you make your app or game stand out? The secret is: you do not need to spend millions on   and user acquisition. In this article, we'll cover six (surprising) ways you can get more users for your application without paying to acquire them. It may sound difficult, but there are some things you can implement to improve your chances of being featured in an app store. Did you know that two-thirds of all the apps shown on Apple\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d tab were either paid or in-app purchases? The latter category had the lion\u2019s share of featured slots, so this is something to consider during development. It\u2019s worth noting that apps fare better than games in this arena, with 70 percent of all features being for apps. Additionally, 46 percent of those purchases were some form of free application. The most important thing to understand is that Apple and Google aren\u2019t handing out featured slots to anyone. These are multi-billion dollar companies, and they want to ensure that featured apps are high in quality and have positive user feedback. Develop an app and experience that is worth the time of both the companies that run the store and the user to whom they are trying to appeal to. Being featured improves the visibility of your app, which means a massive jolt in your impressions count. This   (ASO) leads to a higher number of app downloads, and more installs boost your rank in the store, which again leads to more impressions. This cycle tends to feed itself: you get downloads, get featured, get more downloads, move up the charts, get more downloads. Check out these tools to help keep your ASO efforts organized. As long as you handle the increased traffic responsibly, that merry-go-round can be immensely beneficial. Have you ever used an app and seen that \u201cplease rate us\u201d pop-up? That\u2019s what this is. Rating requests help you get a higher app rating and set up communication with your users. Additionally, this is an excellent way to generate traffic on your app\u2019s store page. A lot of installs on the app will be done after users have checked the  , especially if it\u2019s a paid app. Ensuring that you have a good app rating and good user reviews is paramount to getting pushed up the list. It helps to be responsive to users here to help you build a loyal fanbase. Not only do users pay more attention to a higher review count, but the store listings do too. Getting proper placement in these listings is a big deal and a step towards garnering more organic installs. So much of the traffic you generate will come from these positive metrics. This is why it\u2019s so important to get your community to participate and engage with you on this part of the platform.\u00a0 A fair amount of users don\u2019t think to rate and review your app unless it is exceptional. Sending these reminders allows you to convert installs into reviews and ratings, boosting your chart position and increasing your revenue. The term \u201clocalization\u201d refers not just to translation, but also the degree to which the translation is made accurate. It\u2019s one thing to enter your text into Google Translate, but it\u2019s another to hire a translator who turns it into something useful and culturally recognizable. A lot of apps fail to appeal to international audiences, and the easiest way to do this is to ensure that your translated text is understandable. It also needs to feel natural in the other language as well as culturally appropriate. While we would not put polite words on the end of the pop-up text in English (i.e. sir or ma\u2019am), it might be relevant to do so in Japanese, etc. An even more relevant example can be found right in our own language: the difference between \u201ccolor\u201d and \u201ccolour\u201d for instance, when trying to appeal to a UK audience. You also need to ensure that texts from your screenshots have been accurately translated for certain regions. There would be a weird disconnect between the screenshots and the translated description if they were in two different languages. Take the time to check your logos. Find out which colors are considered more attractive in different countries or which colors may have unintended political affiliations. Localizing your text, imagery, and color scheme helps your users feel like the experience they\u2019re having has been tailored for them. Nothing feels culturally out of place, so they\u2019re comfortable to browse and use your app. This prevents you from losing out to a similar app that might be better localized and therefore, contains a better user experience. This is the best way to gain access to the international market. Increasing your demographic size increases potential revenue streams and establishes a strong brand presence. Apple\u2019s App Store currently has a carousel of six reviews with one facing the customer at a time. Meanwhile, the Google Play store displays four of them inline. Make sure you respond to these reviews and do everything you can to ensure that the \u201cfeatured reviews\u201d show a positive experience with your app. This is your app\u2019s first impression to new users. It is vital for you to engage with these reviews, especially if they happen to be negative. Users want to see that you care about the quality of your product and about the opinions of the people who use it. This is a great first step in  . Keep up with them. It\u2019s hard to know if a new review has been selected or if the review has changed, so check back at least once a month to see whether your response is needed. If the reviews are positive, then they\u2019re a good thing to have on your \u201cdigital doorway\u201d. Respond to them anyway, especially if they contain questions. It will show your willingness to help, even if a user is just passing by your app page. If the reviews are negative, you need to engage with them in a socially appropriate manner. Show your concern for the issues the users have brought forth and convince them that you\u2019ll work on them. Addressing the concerns of negative reviews is already on our list, but it bears repeating and accentuating here. These featured reviews play into how users decide what apps to install. Detailed, positive reviews upfront are a free piece of marketing that can swing indecisive customers into installing your app over a competitor\u2019s. It\u2019s a game of taking every advantage that you can get, and this advantage is very customer-facing. Negative reviews can be depressing. We want every user to have a positive experience with our app, and sometimes failing in that regard doesn\u2019t make us feel good. Negative reviews can still provide benefits, however. If you\u2019ve got a negative review ratio of 10-15 percent, then you need to be on the ball with responses. Often, users who leave negative reviews will leave very little information and a 1-star rating. You can still leverage this by asking them for more details. Not all unhappy users will contact your support team, so the easiest way to get to the problem is by responding to reviews. Also, do not forget to inform the customer that you\u2019ve fixed the issue as it often makes them reconsider their previous bad rating. Users that are checking the reviews for your app might be dissuaded by a lot of negative feedback. It\u2019s important to realize how effective your communication with these reviews can be and how it can sway opinions. Think of negative reviews as a way to improve your app, as well as address feature requests in your development. Users are always quick with criticisms and suggestions, so responding to these reviews is a great way to improve conversion rate. As you improve your app and respond to the users whose review prompted those changes, it\u2019s a normal thing for users to change their rating. The wave of 2- or 3-star ratings adjusted to 4- and 5-star ratings can tremendously improve your conversion rate. Engaging with negative reviews and attempting to fix the issues your app has will build customer loyalty. They\u2019ll see that you respond to user comments, suggestions, and reports. In addition to reaffirming the already-satisfied customers, you get the chance to convert a negative review into a happy customer. The exact details of your reply are slightly less important than the attitude and appearance that you\u2019re cultivating. Set up the workflow to cover user feedback that matters. Check AppFollow strategies to . Retention is the name of the game. After all, you can\u2019t upsell your users if they keep uninstalling your app before you get the chance. Uninstalls are an unavoidable part of the industry. Sometimes the app isn\u2019t the right fit for the user, other times catastrophic bugs ruin the user experience. It\u2019s important to sniff out the causes of uninstalls and eliminate them when possible. Negative reviews can often give you a great window into the problems with your app. Sometimes the interface is unintuitive, or a crash occurs. What matters is developing and deploying patches as soon as possible. It\u2019s also helpful to respond to these negative reviews. Future users that encounter problems might be reassured by your presence in the discussions and stick with the app, trusting that it will be fixed. Uninstalls can lead to negative ratings and reviews, which reflects poorly on the app\u2019s performance on the market. Be sure that you\u2019re providing the services you claim to be in your product description. Also, make sure that you\u2019re regularly releasing updates to fix bugs and issues that your users are having. Being able to track down the reasons that users are fleeing your app can allow you to fix the problems. Regular app monitoring will lead you to developing a better app, as you will be constantly aware of what your app and users are up to. Without daily attempts to make improvements or reach out to your users, you\u2019ll be losing out to a hungry and fierce competition. ", "url": "https://learn.g2.com/how-to-get-more-app-users"}
{"content": "For app owners, staying on top of every single project can be a challenge.\u00a0 \u00a0If you\u2019ve just launched a new app or app version, you may be swamped with comments, both positive and negative. A developer\u2019s response is the first priority for attracting new users and engaging current ones. Developers usually react to the bad reviews, the one- or two-star ratings, thinking these are the most urgent and important ones. However, ignoring the rest of the reviews is what actually gets you into trouble because you end up overlooking many hidden problems, questions, or product drawbacks. This leads to bad reviews that seem to come out of nowhere. By keeping track of user reviews, you can take care of things that really are critical. Below you will find the details on typical app reviews, including which ones have the most impact on your product and its users in order to help you upgrade the quality of your apps and games.\u00a0 Reviews and ratings come in many forms, and some are definitely more valuable than others. It would be nice to think that the overall rating or score of an app on App Store or Google Play is a reliable indicator of an app's actual quality. However, things are not that simple. Not all reviews are equal.\u00a0 These are some of the most common reviews. They are not specific to any star-rating. But they all have one thing in common: length. Let\u2019s face it \u2013 a one-word review such as \u201cWow!\u201d or \u201cAwesome\u201d is not going to help you any more than a review saying your app is \u201cTerrible\u201d. These reviews contribute significantly to your overall app rating, but you can basically ignore them when looking for constructive criticism. These reviews don\u2019t give you any significant value. If you\u2019re able to respond to all the reviews, send something nice with hearts and emojis. But if you don\u2019t have this luxury, you can just skip these and move on to others that will help you improve your app and customer relations. The only time when you should reply is when one of these reviews is the featured or helpful one (these reviews are displayed on the app page) since your potential users will make decisions about whether to install your app based on these reviews. Sometimes users leave really long reviews. The fact that they invested this much time into writing such a detailed review shows that they are angry or concerned. No matter what rating they give, a user that leaves a long review is describing an issue in the product or sharing their ideas on how to improve it. Just a \u201cthank you\u201d note that leads to nothing will make these users furious. They spent their time making suggestions and sharing ideas on improving their favorite product, and the developer just did nothing to address those concerns. One unfortunate app update and we\u2019re getting tons of bad reviews. These are the first reviews you should focus on. Even if a user doesn't complain, your sincere response will make them feel appreciated and their feedback valuable. If users ask questions or suggest a feature \u2014 tag or collect these reviews. This will help you find these users and update your reply once you\u2019ve fixed or added something they wrote about.\u00a0 A subjective responder is a user similar to the previous type. They will write more feedback and have more opinions than most, but they are more likely to rate you on the low side (1 or 2 stars). These are the people who probably have an issue with something and are basing their review on that. They will disagree with the aesthetic choices made, be bored with the next game level, or find your competitor better. These reviews are very much worth your attention and responses. These reviews with a response won\u2019t drive potential users away. Still, make sure you can tell which parts of the review are valid criticism and which are purely subjective. Here you will need to distinguish between the legitimate faults in the app release and users who just like to complain.\u00a0 When you release an app update, dedicate the next day to replies only. You will need to address\u00a0all the bad reviews first and all of the bugs that your development team needs to fix ASAP. When you reply the same day, there\u2019s a chance to win back an angry user by assuring them you'll fix or improve the feature they are complaining about. It's also a great chance to collect feedback and ask for ideas on what to improve. Sometimes these reviews will mark you down for not offering your app for free, or not offering a \u201clite\u201d or \u201cdemo\u201d version. While demos are recommended, don\u2019t let these comments dishearten you. You are 100% entitled to charge for your creations and services. These reviews are written by someone who has a very specific issue and has decided to give you a low score until you address their concerns. These reviews can be the most frustrating of all since the issue might be subjective or a matter of taste. It\u2019s also very common for these users to forget to update their reviews when the issue has been resolved. One-star reviews can be misleading for other potential users reading them. However, they still have some value as they can give you a general idea of what the main issues with your app are. Again, remember to tell the reasonable criticisms apart from the unreasonable. These reviewers give you a real chance to improve your app rating because they are asking for something specific and demand the developer to do something about it. Be realistic \u2014 let them know that you\u2019re working on their problem or plan to work on it in the future. Also, remind these users to revisit their previous rating. You can do this by updating your reply once you have fixed what they were complaining about or added a desired feature to the backlog.\u00a0 Don\u2019t be shy to ask them to give you a higher rating.\u00a0 The market is flooded with apps made by high-earning companies and developers that probably have much higher revenue or much lower moral standards than you do. But what\u2019s worse, they may leave aggressively negative feedback about your app or suggest downloading your competitor instead. Luckily, both App Store and Google Play pay close attention to these spammy reviews and delete them. However, they may still affect your app conversion rate while being displayed on the app page. You don\u2019t really need to reply to these offensive reviews, but if you do, think of it as replying to a new potential customer who is reading it. The best thing you can do is   so they can be deleted faster.\u00a0 Now that you know about the kinds of reviews you\u2019re likely to get, you need to figure out how to respond to them. It\u2019s best to respond with more than just a few words since reviewers like to know that their feedback has been considered and appreciated.\u00a0 Be sure to prioritize the reviews and respond where appropriate. Take care of the cases where your reply will make a difference: criticisms after an update, the longer reviews, the questions, and the \u201cone-star until\u201d. If someone informs you of a legitimate problem with your app, it should be addressed since people will often change their moderate-to-good ratings of your app to a much lower rating if they feel their feedback wasn't taken into consideration. Sometimes you may not have enough time to respond to everything, and that\u2019s ok. If you have never worked with app reviews before, start with the helpful and featured ones since these are the \u201cface\u201d of your app. Then you can go on to the more  . This will give you a better idea of the scope of your app\u2019s issues. The replies alone won\u2019t give you an overall understanding of the issues that users face when dealing with your app or game. Gather the topics that your users are talking about: do you see any issues or questions there? Spend some time every month collecting the likes and dislikes in the reviews to detect hidden issues that other users are too lazy to write about. Moreover, these reviews are more likely to become featured or helpful, and thus being displayed on the app page. The more effectively you work with them, the greater are your chances of getting positive featured reviews that will motivate visitors to install your app.\u00a0 Now you know what kind of reviews to watch out for, and which ones to prioritize. We\u2019ve shown you how to get reviews and then how to respond. Now the ball is in your court. Go out and make those reviews work for you. ", "url": "https://learn.g2.com/types-of-app-reviews"}
